- Madvas on high gas prices:
    - >MetaMask 3.6.2 is out, gas price input is in Gwei, still defaults to 20Gwei, but I tested it with 2Gwei for few transactions and                                       
    it went through within 30 seconds. It’s quiet time of the day, so probably because of that. So if you want to save a bit on gas and 
    not in a hurry, I recommend lowering from default 20Gwei
