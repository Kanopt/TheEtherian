    - In April :~81% chance
    - In May: ~11% chance
    - In June: ~1% chance
    - After June ~7% chance
- Announcement on ICO Tuesday April 4th
    - every participant will get the same price (no bonuses for no one) We have not sold a single token yet.  
    - the % which the team will keep is flexible and only has a lower cap of 10%. We set a cap (~250,000ETH if the prices stays at ~$50) and we will create 10M tokens in total. Now if people are willing to pay a high price per token - this would mean that we need to sell less to reach the cap -> the Gnosis company will keep a higher number of Gnosis token.  
    - only ETH, but with ShapeShift integration

- [Maker Meeting Notes 2017 March 26th](https://steemit.com/makerdao/@kennyrowe/maker-meeting-notes-2017-march-26th)
- Are there any plans for making contracts cheaper?
    - > @ryepdx: Sharding will likely make interactions within a shard cheaper than they would be on a unified blockchain (as exists now). Fees will never be entirely eliminated, but there are plans to allow contracts to pay for their own gas, which would eliminate fees for end users. (Such contracts will have to be carefully constructed, I imagine, to eliminate the possibility of being drained via "spam" invocations. Not sure what the specifics are, TBH.)

- How do you plan on getting people to use and download the app?
    - > @carl: We'll use a number of different acquisition channels, it's wise not to plan around a single means of user acquisition until you have existing data sets to work with.
    - Paid user acquisition - Ad networks (display and search), and referral programs
    - Organic user acquisition - App Store optimisation (ASO)
    - Will also introduce a referral system at some point, comparable to that of dropbox/airbnb/uber
- New slack channel #status-token created for anything related to forthcoming ICO
- Likely 2 contribution periods dependant on meeting compliance and security standards
    - First at end of Q2/early Q3 2017
    - Second in 2018 based upon reaching certain milestones

- Pivoting architecture to be more inclusive of peers (uPort and others) who share the vision for an open music industry.
- Drafting experimental designs in using tokenized models:
    - fostering standards-compliant metadata (eg [COALA IP](https://github.com/COALAIP/specs))
    - sharing said metadata (into IPFS/IPDB/Mediachain/Swarm)
    - making sure to re-use and define what is valid metadata
- Exploring concepts such as [continuous token models](https://medium.com/@simondlr/exploring-continuous-token-models-towards-a-million-networks-of-value-fff153175776%20) and [curation communities](https://medium.com/@simondlr/a-bonded-curation-community-247f14a6de04#.bx59swd45%20) with experiments rolling out soon!

- [WeTrust Interviews with Shawn Wilkison, CEO / CTO of Storj](https://blog.wetrust.io/an-interview-with-shawn-wilkison-ceo-cto-of-storj-e7dbab8fb7f5)
- With 10 days left, WeTrust has raised 822BTC/69,901ETH from 1250 Participants (59.59% of Cap Raised)
- So what are Trustcoins?
    - > @george.wetrust: There will be a fixed amount of Trustcoin issued, and it represents the fees that are generated on the platform between parties and for premium services developed by WeTrust. The value of Trustcoin may depend upon the supply and demand for services offered on the platform we create, but is not a direct result of the effort required in building the platform itself. In that sense, participating in the crowdsale and acquiring Trustcoins in exchange for ETH/ BTC is similar to participating in a kickstarter for software, where one is able to use Trustcoins on future services that are offered by WeTrust *and* by other participants on the platform we are building.
- Will WeTrust seek to be listed on any exchanges?
    - > @george.wetrust: While TRST is going to be ERC20 compliant, WeTrust is not engaging with any body regarding possible uses for TRST tokens after they've been distributed outside its own platform. The past statement was mistakenly written.
