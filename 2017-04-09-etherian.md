## [AKASHA](http://akasha.world/) – Social Media Network[![Join the chat at https://akasha-slack.herokuapp.com/](https://i1.wp.com/theetherian.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/slack_mark_web.png?ssl=1&w=50)](https://akasha-slack.herokuapp.com/)
- It is unlikely that Akasha will work with [BATS](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) anytime soon as they are trying to get away from advertising.
- On light client implementation: 
    - > Mihai: "Basically it is working now, but we are waiting for geth 1.6.0 for stability improvements. We also have some really cool stuff coming."
- Last blog was on the 23rd of February. We look forward to the next one!

## [Augur](https://augur.net/) – Prediction Market[![Join the chat at http://invite.augur.net/](https://i1.wp.com/theetherian.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/slack_mark_web.png?ssl=1&w=50)](http://invite.augur.net/)
- Blog Post: [AUGUR DEVELOPMENT UPDATE – April 5TH](http://blog.augur.net/augur-front-end-update-april-5th/). 
- New auditor looking at Keythereum.

## [BasicAttentionToken](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) - Blockchain Based Digital Advertising
- [Reducing Digital Ad Fraud: A New Deal with BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/reducing-digital-ad-fraud/)
    - > Ad fraud is growing dramatically as no adequate solutions have appeared.The Basic Attention Token (BAT) seeks to radically reduce digital ad fraud, which is estimated to be $16B in 2017, according to a report released a few weeks ago by the World Federation of Advertisers. The sheer number of middlemen present in the ad-tech ecosystem inevitably creates entry points for fraud to flourish. Publishers do not accurately know what ads are programmatically served to their ad slots. All of this is part of what recently prompted P&G’s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard to say: “The days of giving digital a pass are over. It’s time to grow up. It’s time for action.”
- No update on crowdsale

## [Casper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/) (Dev Channel) – Proof of Stake Protocol  
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics](https://badges.gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)  
- Vitalik temporarily shifted the theme of the room to "FC17 Trollbox" to discuss other cryptoeconomic schemes being discussed at the conference.
- Vitalik's conclusions (which I believe can also be applied to Dominic William's deterministic threshold signatures):
    - > "I seriously disagree with him right here because there is one piece of *substantial work* that he is asking users to do namey, stay online with the protocol as it stands I am *seriously* concerned that a whole bunch of users will be lazy, and it will frequently hit the >1/3 offline threshold."
- Vitalik, Vlad, Karl and Loi were together at the FC17 conference in Malta this week.
- Potentially impactful update from Greg Meredith:
    - > "My big update is that i have a proof sketch of an if and only if statement that consensus implies trace and trace implies consensus. (By trace here i mean trace in a traced monoidal category of the kind investigated by Abramsky, Haghverdi, and others.) I can now answer definitively and positively that a non-economic-based consensus can be transformed into a consensus based on slashing conditions."
- SIDH is "not too useful to us"
- IC3 sharding research is unfortunately not a "real" sharding solution.
- Note to Etherian readers: Please be courteous and do not chat in this channel unless you can discuss cryptoeconomics at the academic level of the rest of the room.

- Blog Post [Digix Dev Update — April 8th 2017](https://medium.com/@Digix/digix-dev-update-april-8th-2017-40d200445294).
- > kcchng: Hello yes things are moving, we will post an update this week. Short update currently: Chris fell sick over the weekend but he is back in force today and will provide an update on his progress on spectrum, while Anthony had to fly over to Berkeley for the Sunday workshop, dapphub guys are looking through our code.
- > kcchng: We are working with Yunbi / Gatecoin to come up with a solution where fees will remain. In a decentralized exchange it will also remain. Of course, a different exchange could try and remove the fees involved, but the act of depositing / withdrawal of tokens will also lead to txn fees. However, DGX is actually much more than just trading, it is making gold tokens useful in the ecosystem. So they will be used in payment processing (Debit card integration with Monolith, Onebit by TenX), lending and savings platforms (wetrust), ICOs (Reidao) -- all these names mentioned here are active partnerships we have secured. It'ss application will be much wider than just trading, so as the ecosystem grows, dgx volume grows which will be beneficial to digixDAO.
- Code audit will take 4-6 weeks and will begin on May 1st.
- @whysos3rious will be looking through the code-base in addition to DappHub

- On SAI (simple DAI):
    - SAI (simple dai) is a CDP engine that supports a single collateral type and uses a special model for claiming the collateral which makes the system more simple and have higher liquidity, but also more reliant on the price feeds
    - it uses an asset called SKR to represent claims to the collateral in the event of a global settlement (so it isnt like MKR at all)
    - it will be possible to stop SAI at any time, in the event of a security issue or for other reasons, and then all SAI holders will be able to claim ETH directly at face value (unless the system is undercollateralized, in which case they get a haircut), and the leftover collateral goes to the CDP holders
    - SKR is received when one deposits ETH into the system and can be used as collateral

It's been policy to turn these offers down so they don't interfere with SingularDTV's focus of building a decentralized entertainment industry.  But on very rare occasions, an entity will come along with such a great idea and whose development ladder fits in perfectly with ours, while at the same time adding substantial value to SingularDTV.  In these rare cases of synchronicity we feel obligated to form partnerships.  CODEX is the place where these partnerships take place."

- [Q1 Update](https://blog.ujomusic.com/q1-update-the-mvp-collaborating-towards-an-open-music-industry-infrastructure-25f3ac79a933#.78zh4z521)
- Pivoting architecture to be more inclusive of peers (uPort and others) who share the vision for an open music industry.
- Drafting experimental designs in using tokenized models:
    - fostering standards-compliant metadata (eg [COALA IP](https://github.com/COALAIP/specs))
    - sharing said metadata (into IPFS/IPDB/Mediachain/Swarm)
    - making sure to re-use and define what is valid metadata
- Exploring concepts such as [continuous token models](https://medium.com/@simondlr/exploring-continuous-token-models-towards-a-million-networks-of-value-fff153175776%20) and [curation communities](https://medium.com/@simondlr/a-bonded-curation-community-247f14a6de04#.bx59swd45%20) with experiments rolling out soon!
