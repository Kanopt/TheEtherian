## [BasicAttentionToken](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) - Blockchain Based Digital Advertising
Article posted Friday april 7th - Still no update on crowdsale
- >[BAT Team] - Ad fraud is growing dramatically as no adequate solutions have appeared.The Basic Attention Token (BAT) seeks to radically reduce digital ad fraud, which is estimated to be $16B in 2017, according to a report released a few weeks ago by the World Federation of Advertisers. The sheer number of middlemen present in the ad-tech ecosystem inevitably creates entry points for fraud to flourish. Publishers do not accurately know what ads are programmatically served to their ad slots. All of this is part of what recently prompted P&G’s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard to say: “The days of giving digital a pass are over. It’s time to grow up. It’s time for action.”
