- KC Chng re: demurage fees: 
  >Hello yes there are ways to the demurrage effect to keep dgx demurrage free but to a ratio, has been discussed and there is a solution. There can be two types of tokens in existence, one where it's the traditional dgx token, the other which is a dgx-dem free token derived from dgx so users can choose which they prefer. In terms of redesign, the architecture has already been addressed as per the post, it won't take long as the only portion left is refactoring it. This design will also be less complicated than previously which may reduce audit time, hence the roadmap isn't likely to change drastically.
- >KC Chng: The entire vendor registry and management system is developed in house and will not be open to the public at the moment.
