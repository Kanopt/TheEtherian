## [Casper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/) (Dev Channel) – Proof of Stake Protocol  
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics](https://badges.gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/casper-scaling-and-protocol-economics?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)  
- Vitalik temporarily shifted the theme of the room to "FC17 Trollbox" to discuss other cryptoeconomic schemes being discussed at the conference.
- > Vitalik's conclusions (which I believe can also be applied to Dominic William's deterministic threshold signatures):
I seriously disagree with him right here because there is one piece of *substantial work* that he is asking users to do namey, stay online with the protocol as it stands I am *seriously* concerned that a whole bunch of users will be lazy, and it will frequently hit the >1/3 offline threshold.
- Vitalik, Vlad, Karl and Loi were together at the FC17 conference in Malta this week.
- > Potentially impactful update from Greg Meredith:
My big update is that i have a proof sketch of an if and only if statement that consensus implies trace and trace implies consensus. (By trace here i mean trace in a traced monoidal category of the kind investigated by Abramsky, Haghverdi, and others.) I can now answer definitively and positively that a non-economic-based consensus can be transformed into a consensus based on slashing conditions.
- SIDH is "not too useful to us"
- IC3 sharding research is unfortunately not a "real" sharding solution.
- Note to Etherian readers: Please be courteous and do not chat in this channel unless you can discuss cryptoeconomics at the academic level of the rest of the room.

- Blog Post [Digix Dev Update — April 8th 2017](https://medium.com/@Digix/digix-dev-update-april-8th-2017-40d200445294).
- > kcchng: Hello yes things are moving, we will post an update this week. Short update currently: Chris fell sick over the weekend but he is back in force today and will provide an update on his progress on spectrum, while Anthony had to fly over to Berkeley for the Sunday workshop, dapphub guys are looking through our code.
- > kcchng: We are working with Yunbi / Gatecoin to come up with a solution where fees will remain. In a decentralized exchange it will also remain. Of course, a different exchange could try and remove the fees involved, but the act of depositing / withdrawal of tokens will also lead to txn fees. However, DGX is actually much more than just trading, it is making gold tokens useful in the ecosystem. So they will be used in payment processing (Debit card integration with Monolith, Onebit by TenX), lending and savings platforms (wetrust), ICOs (Reidao) -- all these names mentioned here are active partnerships we have secured. It'ss application will be much wider than just trading, so as the ecosystem grows, dgx volume grows which will be beneficial to digixDAO.
- Code audit will take 4-6 weeks and will begin on May 1st.
- @whysos3rious will be looking through the code-base in addition to DappHub

- [Q1 Update](https://blog.ujomusic.com/q1-update-the-mvp-collaborating-towards-an-open-music-industry-infrastructure-25f3ac79a933#.78zh4z521)
- Pivoting architecture to be more inclusive of peers (uPort and others) who share the vision for an open music industry.
- Drafting experimental designs in using tokenized models:
    - fostering standards-compliant metadata (eg [COALA IP](https://github.com/COALAIP/specs))
    - sharing said metadata (into IPFS/IPDB/Mediachain/Swarm)
    - making sure to re-use and define what is valid metadata
- Exploring concepts such as [continuous token models](https://medium.com/@simondlr/exploring-continuous-token-models-towards-a-million-networks-of-value-fff153175776%20) and [curation communities](https://medium.com/@simondlr/a-bonded-curation-community-247f14a6de04#.bx59swd45%20) with experiments rolling out soon!

- Ability to sign with your fingerprint via a mobile device is in the latest version!
