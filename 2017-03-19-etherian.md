- Auryn Macmillan regarding "Round Project": "please don't advertise that project here. At best it appears to be ill-conceived and blatantly plagiarises the FirstBlood whitepaper, at worst (more than likely) it is just a flat out scam."
- Auryn Macmillan regarding the lack of an updated timeline: "Let me have a chat with the team about this. We've been somewhat deliberate about not setting any more specific dates as we believe it is more important to make the product right than pump it out to make an artificial deadline."

## [Gnosis](https://gnosis.pm/) - Prediction Market

- Best guess for Gnosis token auction is end of April/early May  
- Seeking guest authors for [blog](http://blog.gnosis.pm/)  
- Gnosis ICO maximum planned to be set to $12.5M  
- Great questions by user @gubbings with follow up by Gnosis founder @mkoppelmann: "Assume I created a sports betting app for gnosis. Noone else can lay in my market, its company branded. I make the market to 115%. Thereby with good volume I should turn a profit. Do I pay the ~1% fee on my max liability in the market, my (any) profit overall, my profit on every winning contract, or some other method?"  
> > Currently we are planing to have a 0.5% fee on the max liability.  
- "How does my account balance reflect my max market exposures? Will it update to reflect reduced exposures as bets are taken in markets?"   
> > of course. We aim to to this even much better than betting exchanges today by decomposing market outcomes.  
- "why expose stabletokens to end users? Why not let them use their home fiat currency? I understand tokens are required to make the contracts work and guess a hidden currency exchange to stabletokens wd be required at time of deposit and withdrawal, but surely chances of wide adoption are improved by not taking users out of their comfort zone?"  
> > we expect that most users "home fiat currency" will be available as tokens on the blockchain. Could be as something like the Santander $ (fiat backed) or with some stable coin mechanism with other crypto tokens as collateral (StabL or DAI)  
So - yes - we expect that a user does not even need to know that they use crypto$/€ whatever - like you today do not necessarily realise that the $ on bank X is different than a $ on bank Y  
- "can you provide a general idea of what operating territories are planned at launch and down the line? How is regulatory progress coming along?"  
> > work in progress - we are talking to regulators/ law firms in different jurisdictions including Gibraltar (where Gnosis company will be based, Antigua, Malta, and more)

- [Q1 Update](https://blog.ujomusic.com/q1-update-the-mvp-collaborating-towards-an-open-music-industry-infrastructure-25f3ac79a933#.78zh4z521)
- Pivoting architecture to be more inclusive of peers (uPort and others) who share the vision for an open music industry.
- Drafting experimental designs in using tokenized models:
    - fostering standards-compliant metadata (eg [COALA IP](https://github.com/COALAIP/specs))
    - sharing said metadata (into IPFS/IPDB/Mediachain/Swarm)
    - making sure to re-use and define what is valid metadata
- Exploring concepts such as [continuous token models](https://medium.com/@simondlr/exploring-continuous-token-models-towards-a-million-networks-of-value-fff153175776%20) and [curation communities](https://medium.com/@simondlr/a-bonded-curation-community-247f14a6de04#.bx59swd45%20) with experiments rolling out soon!

- [WeTrust Crowdsale Update](https://medium.com/wetrust-blog/eth-and-btc-contribution-dcd16876bf28#.ietwt4sqs)
    - Some users still unhappy with response and their contributions not being calculated at the same rate as WeTrust
    > > "First day participants were priced at BTC, WT team gets 20MM coins get priced at ICO close date, or vesting schedule, who knows. Pegging to BTC and distribution method was not announced until 15 days into the ICO (sort of like taking an option on ETH @ron). 91.7% (304) of ethereum investors participated on day one and have collectively lost about $1,493,326 due to ETH increase. If you assume worse case for BTC participants have benefitted about $64,032 due to BTC price decrease. 71% of participants contributed Ether representing 80.7% of the total value so far in USD terms. And if you believe that hiring developers will ultimately require fiat it’s a windfall of $1.5MM for WeTrust from day one investors." - @ncavet, WeTrust investor
