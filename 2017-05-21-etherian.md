- >KC Chng: "DigixDao governance will be worked upon after the launch of dgx 2.0. That's when u can start pledging dgds on proposals and receiving dgx as a reward for the work done for digixdao."
- >KC Chng: "There will be a coin lock mechanism for the quarterly pledges, if they are not locked, it would mean they are transferable and have not participated in curating the proposals. Hence those dgds have not participated in the proposals, and hence no fees are due to those dgds."
